## Important Notes

- The ngrok URL changes every time you restart ngrok, You can also use a static ngrok URL by running `ngrok http 8000 --domain=your-custom-domain.com`, you can get a custom domain from [here](https://dashboard.ngrok.com/domains)
- You'll need to update the Webhook URL in the Meta Developer Portal whenever the ngrok URL changes
