### 1. Create a virtual environment

```shell
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
```

### 2. Install libraries

### 3. Typefully API Setup

To enable content scheduling and posting:

- **Create a Typefully Account**: Sign up at typefully.com
- **Get API Key**: Navigate to Typefully settings â†’ Developer â†’ Generate API Key
- **Connect Social Accounts**: In your Typefully dashboard, connect your Twitter and LinkedIn accounts

The application uses Typefully's API to schedule and publish your content automatically.
Without a valid Typefully API key and properly connected accounts, the scheduling functionality will not work.

### 4. Export API Keys

Mistral API key is optional, but if you'd like to test:

```shell
